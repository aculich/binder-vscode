    "2.  **Find the VS Code Link:**\n",
    "    * In JupyterLab (recommended): Look for the VS Code icon in the Launcher tab, or go to `File` -> `New Launcher` and click the VS Code icon.\n",
    "    * Alternatively, you can manually navigate: Change the URL in your browser. If your Jupyter session URL is `https://<binder-hub-url>/user/<username>/lab`, change the `/lab` part to `/vscode/`. The full URL will look something like `https://<binder-hub-url>/user/<username>/vscode/`.\n",
    "3.  **First Launch:** The very first time you access the `/vscode/` URL in a new Binder session, `jupyter-vscode-proxy` might need to download `code-server`. This can take a minute or two, so be patient. You might see log messages in the terminal where you launched Jupyter (if running locally) or just a loading screen in the browser.\n",
    "4.  **Use VS Code:** Once loaded, you'll have a fully functional VS Code interface running in your browser, accessing the filesystem of your Binder container.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can open this notebook (`hello_world_vscode.ipynb`) or create new files directly within the VS Code interface."
